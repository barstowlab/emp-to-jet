ATP + Acetyl-CoA + HCO3- → ADP + Orthophosphate + Malonyl-CoA
Acetyl-CoA + Malonyl-CoA → Acetoacetyl-CoA + CO2 + CoA
Acetoacetyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → 3R-3-Hydroxybutanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
3R-3-Hydroxybutanoyl-CoA → But-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
But-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → Butanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
Acetyl-CoA + Butanoyl-CoA → CoA + 3-Oxohexanoyl-CoA
3-Oxohexanoyl-CoA + NADH + Hplus → S-Hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA + NADplus
S-Hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA → trans-hex-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
trans-hex-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → Hexanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
Acetyl-CoA + Hexanoyl-CoA → CoA + 3-Oxooctanoyl-CoA
3-Oxooctanoyl-CoA + NADH + Hplus → S-Hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA + NADplus
S-Hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA → trans-oct-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
trans-oct-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → Octanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
Octanoyl-CoA + H2O → CoA + Octanoic acid
