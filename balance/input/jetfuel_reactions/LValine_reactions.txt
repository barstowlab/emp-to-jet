2*Pyruvate → (S)-2-Acetolactate + CO2
(S)-2-Acetolactate → 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid
3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid + NADPH → (R)-2,3-Dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate
(R)-2,3-Dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate → 3-Methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid
3-Methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid + Thiamin diphosphate → 2_Methyl_1_hydroxypropyl_ThPP + CO2
2_Methyl_1_hydroxypropyl_ThPP + Enzyme N6_lipoyl_lysine → Dihydrolipoyllysine_residue_2_methylpropanoyl_transferase S_2_methylpropanoyl_dihydrolipoyllysine + Thiamin diphosphate
CoA + Dihydrolipoyllysine_residue_2_methylpropanoyl_transferase S_2_methylpropanoyl_dihydrolipoyllysine → 2_Methylpropanoyl_CoA + Enzyme N6_dihydrolipoyl_lysine
NADH + NADPplus → NADPH + NADplus
