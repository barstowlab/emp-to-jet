Propionyl-CoA + CO2 → (S)-Methylmalonyl-CoA
CO2 + H2O → HCO3- + Hplus
ATP + Acetyl-CoA + HCO3- → ADP + Orthophosphate + Malonyl-CoA
Propionyl-CoA + (S)-Methylmalonyl-CoA → 5-4-methyl-Acetoacetyl-CoA + CO2 + CoA
5-4-methyl-Acetoacetyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → 3R-4-methyl-3-Hydroxypentanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
3R-4-methyl-3-Hydroxypentanoyl-CoA → 4-methyl-Pent-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
4-methyl-Pent-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → 4-methyl-Pentanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
Malonyl-CoA + 4-methyl-Pentanoyl-CoA → CoA + CO2 + 4-methyl-Oxoheptanoyl-CoA
4-methyl-Oxoheptanoyl-CoA + NADH + Hplus → S-4-methyl-Hydroxyheptanoyl-CoA + NADplus
S-4-methyl-Hydroxyheptanoyl-CoA → 4-methyl-trans-hept-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
4-methyl-trans-hept-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → 4-methyl-Heptanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
4-methyl-Heptanoyl-CoA + H2O → CoA + 4-methyl-Heptanoic acid
4-methyl-Heptanoic acid → CO2 + 3-methyl-Hexane
NADH + NADPplus → NADPH + NADplus
