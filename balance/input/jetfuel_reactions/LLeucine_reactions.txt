2*Pyruvate → (S)-2-Acetolactate + CO2
(S)-2-Acetolactate → 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid
3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid + NADPH → (R)-2,3-Dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate
(R)-2,3-Dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate → 3-Methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid
Acetyl-CoA + 3-Methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid → alpha-Isopropylmalate
alpha-Isopropylmalate → 2-Isopropylmaleate
2-Isopropylmaleate → (2R,3S)-3-Isopropylmalate 
(2R,3S)-3-Isopropylmalate → (2S)-2-Isopropyl-3-oxosuccinate + NADH
(2S)-2-Isopropyl-3-oxosuccinate → 4-Methyl-2-oxopentanoate + CO2  
4-Methyl-2-oxopentanoate + Thiamin diphosphate → 3_Methyl_1_hydroxybutyl_ThPP + CO2
3_Methyl_1_hydroxybutyl_ThPP + Enzyme N6_lipoyl_lysine → Dihydrolipoyllysine_residue_2_methylpropanoyl_transferase S_3_methylbutanoyl_dihydrolipoyllysine + Thiamin diphosphate
CoA + Dihydrolipoyllysine_residue_2_methylpropanoyl_transferase S_3_methylbutanoyl_dihydrolipoyllysine → 3_Methylbutanoyl_CoA + Enzyme N6_dihydrolipoyl_lysine
NADH + NADPplus → NADPH + NADplus
