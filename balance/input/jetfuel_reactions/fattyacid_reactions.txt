ATP + Acetyl-CoA + HCO3minus → ADP + Orthophosphate + Malonyl-CoA
Acetyl-CoA + Malonyl-CoA → Acetoacetyl-CoA + CO2 + CoA
Acetoacetyl-CoA + NADPH +Hplus → 3R-3-Hydroxybutanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
3R-3-Hydroxybutanoyl-CoA → But-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
But-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → FABaseoyl-CoA + NADPplus
Acetyl-CoA + FABaseoyl-CoA → CoA + 3-OxoFAanoyl-CoA
3-OxoFAanoyl-CoA + NADH + Hplus → S-HydroxyFAanoyl-CoA + NADplus
S-HydroxyFAanoyl-CoA → trans-FA-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
2*trans-FA-2-enoyl-CoA + 2*NADPH + 2*Hplus → FAanoyl-CoA + 2*NADPplus
FAanoyl-CoA + H2O → CoA + FAacid
