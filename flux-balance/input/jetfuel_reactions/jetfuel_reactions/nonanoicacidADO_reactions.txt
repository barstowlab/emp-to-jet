Propionyl-CoA + Malonyl-CoA → 5-Acetoacetyl-CoA + CO2 + CoA
5-Acetoacetyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → 3R-3-Hydroxypentanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
3R-3-Hydroxypentanoyl-CoA → Pent-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
Pent-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → Pentanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
Malonyl-CoA + Pentanoyl-CoA → CoA + CO2 + 3-Oxoheptanoyl-CoA
3-Oxoheptanoyl-CoA + NADH + Hplus → S-Hydroxyheptanoyl-CoA + NADplus
S-Hydroxyheptanoyl-CoA → trans-hept-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
trans-hept-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → Heptanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
Malonyl-CoA + Heptanoyl-CoA → CoA + CO2 + 3-Oxononanoyl-CoA
