CO2 + H2O → HCO3- + Hplus
ATP + Acetyl-CoA + HCO3- → ADP + Orthophosphate + Malonyl-CoA
Propionyl-CoA + Malonyl-CoA → 5-Acetoacetyl-CoA + CO2 + CoA
5-Acetoacetyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → 3R-3-Hydroxypentanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
3R-3-Hydroxypentanoyl-CoA → Pent-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
Pent-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → Pentanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
Malonyl-CoA + Pentanoyl-CoA → CoA + CO2 + 3-Oxoheptanoyl-CoA
3-Oxoheptanoyl-CoA + NADH + Hplus → S-Hydroxyheptanoyl-CoA + NADplus
S-Hydroxyheptanoyl-CoA → trans-hept-2-enoyl-CoA + H2O
trans-hept-2-enoyl-CoA + NADPH + Hplus → Heptanoyl-CoA + NADPplus
Heptanoyl-CoA + NADH + Hplus → CoA + Heptanal + NADplus
Heptanal + Oxygen + 2*NADPH + 2*Hplus → Hexane + Formate + H2O + 2*NADPplus
Formate → CO2 + NADH + Hplus
NADH + NADPplus → NADPH + NADplus
